# Pi-hole and Unbound Installation with Ansible

This repository contains an Ansible playbook for installing Pi-hole and Unbound on a target Ubuntu system.

## Description

The Ansible playbook contained in this repository performs the following tasks:

1. Updates and upgrades the packages on the target system.
2. Installs necessary packages including curl, dnsutils, and netcat.
3. Checks if Unbound is already installed on the target system.
4. If Unbound is not installed, the playbook installs it.
5. After the Unbound installation, the playbook creates a configuration file at /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/pi-hole.conf with the required settings for Unbound.

This playbook is intended to be run on a Ubuntu system, but it may work on other Linux distributions as well.

## Usage

To use the playbook, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local system:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git

```

3. Run the playbook on your target hosts:

```
ansible-playbook -i your_inventory_file install_pihole_and_unbound.yml -K
```

Replace `your_inventory_file` with the path to your Ansible inventory file. The `-K` option will prompt you for the sudo password.
